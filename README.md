## Quick Start

**Step 1 — Get your Bybit API credentials** *(skip if you only need market data)*

**Option A — HMAC-SHA256 (standard, recommended for most users)**

1. Log in to [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com) and go to **Account & Security → API Management**
2. Click **Create New Key**, select **System-generated API Key**
3. Set the permissions you need (read-only is recommended for safety)
4. Save the **API Key** and **API Secret** — the secret is shown only once
5. Use `BYBIT_API_KEY` + `BYBIT_API_SECRET` in your config

**Option B — RSA-SHA256 (self-generated key pair)**

1. Generate an RSA key pair locally:
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out bybit_private.pem 2048
   openssl rsa -in bybit_private.pem -pubout -out bybit_public.pem
   chmod 600 bybit_private.pem
   ```
2. Log in to [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com) and go to **Account & Security → API Management**
3. Click **Create New Key**, select **Self-generated API Key**
4. Paste the contents of `bybit_public.pem` into the public key field
5. Save the **API Key** shown after creation
6. Use `BYBIT_API_KEY` + `BYBIT_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` (absolute path to `bybit_private.pem`) in your config

**Step 2 — Connect to your AI assistant**

Choose the section below that matches your tool (Claude Desktop, Cursor, or VS Code).

**Step 3 — Verify the connection**

After configuring, restart your AI assistant and ask:
> *"What's the current BTCUSDT price?"*

If you get a live price back, the server is connected and working.

**Step 4 — Let the AI learn the full capability in one prompt** *(optional but recommended)*

Paste the following into your AI assistant to have it read the official documentation and start helping you trade:

```
Please read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bybit-exchange/trading-mcp/main/README.md save it as a mcp, and help me trade on Bybit.
```

The AI will read the README, understand all available tools, and be ready to assist with market data queries, account management, and more.

## Configuration Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BYBIT_API_KEY` | For auth endpoints | — | Your Bybit API key |
| `BYBIT_API_SECRET` | HMAC mode | — | Your Bybit API secret (HMAC-SHA256 signing) |
| `BYBIT_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` | RSA mode | — | Absolute path to your RSA private key PEM file (RSA-SHA256 signing) |
| `BYBIT_TESTNET` | No | `false` | Set to `true` to use the testnet |

Market data tools work without credentials. Authenticated tools require `BYBIT_API_KEY` plus **exactly one** signing credential:

- **HMAC-SHA256** (default) — set `BYBIT_API_SECRET`. Works with **System-generated API keys**.
- **RSA-SHA256** — set `BYBIT_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` pointing to a PEM file on disk. Required for **Self-generated (user-uploaded) RSA key pairs**. The server adds `X-BAPI-SIGN-TYPE: 2` automatically.

> **Quick rule:** chose "System-generated" on Bybit → use HMAC. Chose "Self-generated" → use RSA.
>
> If both `BYBIT_API_SECRET` and `BYBIT_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` are set (e.g. a system-level env var conflicts with your MCP config), RSA takes precedence and a warning is printed to the server log. Remove `BYBIT_API_SECRET` to suppress the warning.

---

## Usage with Claude Desktop

> **First-time setup:** Claude Desktop will show an authorization prompt the first time each tool is called. Click **"Always allow"** to permanently approve it — you won't be asked again.

**1. Find your config file**

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |

Open the file in any text editor (create it if it doesn't exist).

**2. Add the MCP server config**

HMAC mode (System-generated API key):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bybit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "bybit-official-trading-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "BYBIT_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "BYBIT_API_SECRET": "your_api_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

RSA mode (Self-generated API key):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bybit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "bybit-official-trading-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "BYBIT_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "BYBIT_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/bybit_private.pem"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Replace the values with your actual Bybit credentials. Use one signing mode only — do not set both `BYBIT_API_SECRET` and `BYBIT_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`.
> If the file already has other MCP servers, add the `"bybit"` block inside the existing `"mcpServers"` object.

**3. Restart Claude Desktop**

Quit and reopen Claude Desktop. The Bybit tools will be available automatically on next launch.

**For testnet:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bybit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "bybit-official-trading-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "BYBIT_API_KEY": "your_testnet_api_key",
        "BYBIT_API_SECRET": "your_testnet_api_secret",
        "BYBIT_TESTNET": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

      "args": ["-y", "bybit-official-trading-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "BYBIT_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "BYBIT_API_SECRET": "your_api_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

RSA mode (Self-generated API key):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "bybit": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "bybit-official-trading-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "BYBIT_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "BYBIT_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/bybit_private.pem"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Enable MCP in VS Code settings**

Open VS Code Settings (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`), search for `mcp`, and ensure **MCP support** is enabled for your AI extension (e.g. GitHub Copilot).

**3. Reload the window**

## Example Prompts

Once connected to an AI assistant, you can use natural language:

**Market data:**
- "What is the current BTC/USDT price?"
- "Show me the order book for ETHUSDT with depth 50"
- "Get the last 10 BTC perpetual klines on the 1-hour interval"
- "What are the current funding rates for the top 5 perpetual contracts?"
- "What's the open interest for BTCUSDT?"

**Account & Asset:**
- "What's my wallet balance?"
- "Show me my recent transaction log"
- "What are my maker/taker fee rates?"
- "Show me my total assets across all sub-accounts"
- "What's my portfolio margin status?"

**User & Sub-accounts:**
- "List all my sub-accounts"
- "Show me the permissions and VIP level of my current API key"
- "What account types do my sub-accounts use?"
- "Who have I invited through the referral program?"

**WebSocket / Real-time:**
- "Subscribe to the BTCUSDT orderbook and give me a snapshot"
- "Get the latest execution records from my account"
- "What are my current open positions?"

---

## WebSocket Pattern Details

WebSocket tools are compatible with MCP's request/response model:

1. The tool opens a WebSocket connection to Bybit's streaming endpoint
2. Subscribes to the requested channel (with auth handshake for private channels)
3. Collects the specified number of messages (default: 1) or waits up to `timeoutMs` (default: 5000 ms)
4. Returns the collected snapshot and closes the connection

This makes real-time data accessible in a single tool call without managing persistent connections.

---

## Security Notes

- API keys are read from environment variables at call time, never hardcoded
- Two signing modes are supported: **HMAC-SHA256** (default, via `BYBIT_API_SECRET`) and **RSA-SHA256** (via `BYBIT_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`) per Bybit's V5 API specification
- For RSA mode, store the PEM file with `chmod 600` and never commit it to source control
- Never share your API secret or commit it to source control
- Use API keys with minimal required permissions (read-only where possible)

---

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Loading / "No MCP servers configured"

If you've configured the server but your AI assistant shows no tools or "No MCP servers configured":

#### 1. Check the correct configuration file

Claude Code reads MCP server config from `~/.claude.json` (per-project), **not** from `~/.claude/settings.json`. The recommended way to add the server is via CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add bybit -- npx -y bybit-official-trading-server@latest
```

This writes the config to the correct location.

#### 2. Use the full path to `node` / `npx` if needed

Some environments spawn subprocesses without loading your shell profile (`.zshrc` / `.zprofile`), so `PATH` may not include the Node.js bin directory. Find the full path and use it explicitly:

```bash
# Find your npx path
which npx
# Example: /usr/local/bin/npx
```

#### 3. Restart your AI assistant after configuration changes

MCP servers connect at session startup. After adding or changing config, you must **exit and restart** your AI assistant for changes to take effect.

#### 4. Verify the server starts correctly

Test that the server can start and respond to MCP protocol:

```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"0.1"}}}' | npx -y bybit-official-trading-server@latest
```

#### 5. Don't run the server manually

Your AI client manages the MCP server process itself via stdio. A manually started server instance is **completely separate** — the client won't connect to it. Let the client handle the lifecycle automatically.

### Quick Diagnosis Checklist

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No tools shown after config | Config in wrong file | Use `claude mcp add` CLI command |
| Config exists but tools don't load | `npx` / `node` not found in PATH | Use absolute path to `npx` |
| Tools loaded before but not now | Session not restarted after config change | Restart your AI assistant |
| Authentication errors | Missing or incorrect API credentials | Check `BYBIT_API_KEY` and `BYBIT_API_SECRET` (HMAC) or `BYBIT_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` (RSA) |
